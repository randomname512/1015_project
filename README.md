# Youtube dislikes
## About
Dislikes are a good metric for judging the quality of a video before you watch it. With youtube removing dislikes, we want to attempt to predict youtube dislikes from other publically available data on the video.

## Problem
- Predicting dislike count on a youtube video based on other data.
- What kind of techniques are required to do such a thing.

## Models
- Linear regression
- Deep learning

## Conclusion
- Basic linear regression is not very effective on complex and varied data with no clearly defined relationship.
- Breaking the data down to individual channels and using that to estabish a baseline seems to help marginally.
- Ultimately the problem can be solved to a certain extent with machine learning taking into accout the text data and learning the hidden relationships that we cannot find ourselfs.
